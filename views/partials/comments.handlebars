<!-- In Handlebars.js, we can use the trusty keyword this to refer to the parent object 
or array that's available in the context of the partial. Data that's passed to a template 
file is technically always part of this, but when dealing with objects, we can simply 
access the object properties directly -e.g., vote_count instead of this.vote_count-. Because 
arrays don't have named properties like objects do, we're forced to access the array as this. -->
