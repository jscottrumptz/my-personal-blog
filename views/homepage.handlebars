<!-- Note the use of -#each- to begin the loop and -/each- to define where it ends. 
Any HTML code in between -e.g., the <li> element- will be repeated for every item in posts.

We can make this a little clearer, however, by declaring a variable name in the -#each- 
expression and using that name for the subsequent placeholders.-->

<ol class="post-list">
  {{#each posts as |post|}}
  <li>
    {{> post-info post }}
  </li>
  {{/each}}
</ol>
